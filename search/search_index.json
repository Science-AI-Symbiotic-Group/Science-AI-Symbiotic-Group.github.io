Hi there, I am Kevin Luke and it is amazing if you have ventured here to know more about my Science-AI Symbiotic Group. I am the principal investigator/leader at the group. I have formed this group by keeping research in mind. I did my BSc (Physics)(2019) and MSc (Astrophysics)(2021) from St. Xavier's College, Autonomous, Mumbai. I am honored and humbled to have completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at this highest ranked institution in India. In my studies at St. Xaviers I was pushed beyond the box to make innovations by working/studying with the best minds in the field of Astrophysics. Due to this I secured a position as a MSc thesis student world with renowed CIFR Azrieli fellowship scientist and professor Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Navy Nagar, Colaba. Working for thesis there I developed a new cutting edge machine learning technology for CHIME/FRB telescope located at BC, Canada. I am a member of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. After MSc I took up position as a project student at Dr. Tendulkar's TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab where I am currently working as my second job. At TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab I am currently working to developing a new software/hardware backend for CHIME/FRB telescope called as CHIME/Slow which will one of the most powerful backends to discover very high energy explosions called as Fast Radio Burst/FRBs originating from neutron stars, magnetars and black holes from billions of light years away. I also manage daily operations of the CHIME/FRB telescope to ensure smooth collection of data and troubleshooting of problems encountered at the telescope's hardware/software interface. It is my great fortune to work additionally at Seven Square Academy where I got in touch with one of the amazing students ever. Hence I have taken a task that I, myself, will do my best to inculcate knowledge and research aptitude in my students working at Science-AI Symbiotic Group. Apart from education and research I learn German, have completed official Goethe A1, A2 exams recognised by German Government and I code extensively towards ML, AI and their integration in astronomy.","title":"Leader"},{"location":"leader/#our-leader","text":"Hi there, I am Kevin Luke and it is amazing if you have ventured here to know more about my Science-AI Symbiotic Group.

But did we ever think how beautiful and complex the surface of the moon is? Well, at our group we aim to answer these questions. (Some of our students with Mr Kevin at moon observations meet) Abstract Students will collaborate, apply critical thinking skills, and utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including topographical data, terrain height, terrain slope, regolith temperature, and iron oxide abundances. Methodology The Lunar Research Project for students will be conducted through a structured process: 1. Lunar Observation Journal: The project begins with students individually observing the Moon on different dates, maintaining lunar observation journals with telescope. This phase promotes independent scientific inquiry and systematic data collection. 2. Research Assignment: 2.1 Selection of Lunar Areas: Each student will be assigned a specific lunar area for further investigation. These areas are carefully selected to encompass a range of geological features,including craters, maria, highlands, and other notable formations. 2.2 Data Collection and Tools: Students will utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including: A) Topography Features: Utilizing topographical data, students will examine the Moon's surface, identifying mountains, valleys, and plains. B) Terrain Height: Analysis of terrain height data will provide insights into the variations across the lunar terrain. C) Terrain Slope:The project aims to determine the steepness and gradients of the lunar surface using slope data. D) Regolith Temperature: Data analysis will reveal temperature variations across the lunar surface. E) Iron Oxide Abundances (FeO): Students will investigate the presence and distribution of iron oxide on the Moon, relating it to geological processes and lunar formation theories. 3. Data Analysis and Collaboration: In the data analysis phase, students work collaboratively,draw conclusions and fill in a data analysis report. Regular meetings and discussions promote teamwork and communication skills. The lunar observation journal will be compiled with individual data analysis reports into a comprehensive report Photos Students of the group have captured a lot of moon, saturn, jupiter photos from a 6 inch Newtonian reflector telescope.
