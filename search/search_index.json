He met a shy programmer who frequented the club, together they both experimented on how to use programming for creating beautiful art. Years later they ended up developing TerraVision, the forerunner of Google Earth. They made TerraVision out of pure curiosity to experiment how programming can make various abstract art possible.This exactly was my inspiration to use programming and AI to built art. For art I selected motion pictures. Motion pictures convey a ton of art to the audience. A group of students excited on programming, acting and direction came forward and there we go, we are making a short movie and a dance video with programming and AI. Abstract Students collaborate to code, write and direct a short movie and a music video with OpenCV computer vision and Google's Mediapipe AI code library in Python programming language. Methodology The whole project is structured with students into two subgroups namely Tech Team and Art Team and will be realised as follows: 1) Tech Team's Development of codes The backbone of the whole project was programming. Students guided by Mr. Kevin started to gain working knowledge of Python. A) Animated motion picture After gaining practical knowledge of Python students were trained on computer vision to learn how computer would process images and motion pictures programmatically. They then started to develop a suit of codes which utilised OpenCV computer vision library implementation in Python. Codes were developed which used background noise removal methods and contour detection methods to convert a motion picture in RGB palette to sketch art, hereby giving an animation feel to the traditional RBG colors' based motion pictures. The codes were developed with keeping error handling to ensure the code would run without errors. The codes were then connected to smartphone cameras which would act as webcams by using a WIFI based tool webcam tool called IRIUM available on Windows, Android and Linux. B) Dance video Parallel to the development of motion picture codes, students started to investigate how a person dancing can be rendered to doodle art dancing. Hence after some research Google's Mediapipe Python library was utilised to make an OpenCV based Python code which detects the poses of a person dancing and then conducts holistic pose detection and renders a dancing doodle art. The code was again connected to smartphones via the method described above to record the videos. 2) Art Team's Creation and Direcion Students with extensive background in acting, direction, choreography worked to develop a short script for the animated motion picture and the dance video. A) Animated motion picture A script was made by the Art team. It was about a boy who enters a forbidden cursed VR world after using a cursed VR set. Although he tries his best to escape the VR world he gets abducted by strange figures leading to the ending in cliffhanger. B) Dance video Students with extensive experience in dancing danced to popular Bollywood songs. 3) Debut of the videos at SSAN Annual Day 28/01/2024 Initial, limited screening of the animated motion picture and the dance video was done at the school annual day to enthusiastic positive response from the audience. 4) Release of videos on Youtube after further modifications In future the videos will be released after undergoing further refinements to popular streaming platform Youtube. 5) Publication of a research paper In future a research paper will be authored by Mr. Kevin Luke and the students. The paper will detail the work conducted and will show how coding and AI can be integrated at school level to enable logical and analytical thinking among the students therby leading to creating of meaningful and impactful art.

Hi there, I am Kevin Luke and it is amazing if you have ventured here to know more about my Science-AI Symbiotic Group. I am the principal investigator/leader at the group. I have formed this group by keeping research in mind. I did my BSc (Physics)(2019) and MSc (Astrophysics)(2021) from St. Xavier's College, Autonomous, Mumbai. I am honored and humbled to have completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at this highest ranked institution in India. In my studies at St. Xaviers I was pushed beyond the box to make innovations by working/studying with the best minds in the field of Astrophysics. Due to this I secured a position as a MSc thesis student work with renowed CIFR Azrieli fellowship scientist and professor Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Navy Nagar, Colaba. Working for thesis there I developed a new cutting edge machine learning technology for CHIME/FRB telescope located at BC, Canada. I am a member of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. After MSc I took up position as a project student at Dr. Tendulkar's TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab where I am currently working as my second job. At TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab I am currently working to developing a new software/hardware backend for CHIME/FRB telescope called as CHIME/Slow which will one of the most powerful backends to discover very high energy explosions called as Fast Radio Burst/FRBs originating from neutron stars, magnetars and black holes from billions of light years away. I also manage daily operations of the CHIME/FRB telescope to ensure smooth collection of data and troubleshooting of problems encountered at the telescope's hardware/software interface. It is my great fortune to work additionally at Seven Square Academy where I got in touch with one of the amazing students ever. Hence I have taken a task that I, myself, will do my best to inculcate knowledge and research aptitude in my students working at Science-AI Symbiotic Group. Apart from education and research I learn German, have completed official Goethe A1, A2 exams recognised by German Government and I code extensively towards ML, AI and their integration in astronomy.","title":"Leader"},{"location":"leader/#our-leader","text":"Hi there, I am Kevin Luke and it is amazing if you have ventured here to know more about my Science-AI Symbiotic Group.

But did we ever think how beautiful and complex the surface of the moon is? Well, at our group we aim to answer this question. Abstract Students collaborate, apply critical thinking skills, and utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including topographical data, terrain height, terrain slope, regolith temperature, and iron oxide abundances. Methodology The Lunar Research Project for students will be conducted through a structured process: 1. Lunar Observation Journal: The project begins with students individually observing the Moon on different dates, maintaining lunar observation journals with telescope. This phase promotes independent scientific inquiry and systematic data collection. 2. Research Assignment: 2.1 Selection of Lunar Areas: Each student will be assigned a specific lunar area for further investigation. These areas are carefully selected to encompass a range of geological features,including craters, maria, highlands, and other notable formations. 2.2 Data Collection and Tools: Students will utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including: A) Topography Features: Utilizing topographical data, students will examine the Moon's surface, identifying mountains, valleys, and plains. B) Terrain Height: Analysis of terrain height data will provide insights into the variations across the lunar terrain. C) Terrain Slope:The project aims to determine the steepness and gradients of the lunar surface using slope data. D) Regolith Temperature: Data analysis will reveal temperature variations across the lunar surface. E) Iron Oxide Abundances (FeO): Students will investigate the presence and distribution of iron oxide on the Moon, relating it to geological processes and lunar formation theories. 3. Data Analysis and Collaboration: In the data analysis phase, students work collaboratively,draw conclusions and fill in a data analysis report. Regular meetings and discussions promote teamwork and communication skills. The lunar observation journal will be compiled with individual data analysis reports into a comprehensive report. Photos Students of the group have captured a lot of moon, saturn, jupiter photos from a 6 inch Newtonian reflector telescope.

One way to produce hydrogen gas for soil fertilization is through electrolysis, which is the process of using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gas.

Once you have assembled the generator, hydrogen gas will begin to bubble out of the electrolyte solution. You can collect the gas in a balloon or other container and apply it to your soil by releasing it directly into the soil or mixing it with water and applying it as a liquid fertilizer.
